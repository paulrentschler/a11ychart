# a11yCharts

CSS styling and javascript code for creating accessible bar charts in HTML
documents.

The javascript code provides functionality to build accessible bar charts in
an HTML document by providing a JSON data structure.


## Requirements

jQuery is required to use the included javascript code to generate the
accessible charts from JSON data.

Tested with jQuery 1.10.2 (should work with older versions)
